# Video Playback Control Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed the application structure and identified video content in templates/videos.html
- [x] Added unique IDs to all YouTube iframe elements (player1 through player9)
- [x] Enabled YouTube JavaScript API by adding ?enablejsapi=1 to all iframe URLs
- [x] Implemented YouTube IFrame Player API for proper video control
- [x] Added onPlayerStateChange event handler to pause other videos when one starts playing
- [x] Replaced the old postMessage-based script with the new API-based approach

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test the video control functionality by running the Flask application
- [ ] Verify that clicking on different videos properly pauses the previous one
- [ ] Check functionality across different browsers if possible
- [ ] Ensure the background video in index.html doesn't interfere with the YouTube videos

## Notes
- The background video in index.html is autoplay muted loop, so it shouldn't conflict with the YouTube videos
- The new implementation uses the official YouTube IFrame Player API for better reliability
- All 9 YouTube videos now have proper IDs and API integration
